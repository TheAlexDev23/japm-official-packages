# japm-official-packages
Official repository for japm packages

[JAPM](https://github.com/TheAlexDev23/japm) is just a package manager that I'm working on on my free time. This is the official and main repo for it's packages. 

If you want to contribute by creating a package please refer to the [creating guidelines](docs/CREATING.md). A package that does not follow the standart format might be rejected by japm and not be installed.
